            <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p class="p">
            I am a trained Physicist(Electronics major), graduate of Maasai mara University class of 2025.<br>
            Having been an electronics major, I have a deep interest in data communication as well as computer networks<br>
            I have tackled several research based projects in both physics and electronics.<br>
            One of my strengths is realising how consistency can yield desirable outcomes if powered by diligence, irrespective of the time required to complete the task.<br>
            In this article I have highlighted some of my complete projects as well as others yet to be completed, I also included some of the weaknesses and strengths that have impacted my studies.<br>
